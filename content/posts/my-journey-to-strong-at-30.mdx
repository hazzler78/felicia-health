I tried every all-or-nothing plan and kept burning out. Things changed when I focused on the smallest possible actions: daily walks, protein at meals, and 2 short strength sessions per week. The consistency added up, and I finally felt strong.

If you're starting out, begin with one habit this week. Keep it doable. Celebrate every rep.
