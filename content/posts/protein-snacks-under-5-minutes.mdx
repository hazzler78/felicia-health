Getting protein in doesn't have to be complicated. Here are three fast options I reach for when life's busy:

1. Greek yogurt + berries + drizzle of honey.
2. Protein shake with almond milk and a handful of ice.
3. Rice cakes topped with cottage cheese and everything bagel seasoning.

Aim for 20-30g of protein per snack if you can. Keep it simple and repeat what works.
